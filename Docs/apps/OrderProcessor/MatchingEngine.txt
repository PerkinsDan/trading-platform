What is it?
    The MatchingEngine class is a utiltiy class filled with static methods. 
    It contains the core order matching methods that are called each time an order
    is placed. Its role is to look at a TradeBook and find as many matches between
    orders as it can, create MatchingDetails DTOs for each match and return them.

When do we use it?
    During trading hours, this class is called every single time an order is submitted.
    On each call, it evalutes the TradeBook, matches orders and generates DTOs for each 
    match until there are no more possible matches. It is called exactly once per order,
    but each call may result in more than one match, as orders are matched in price-time
    priority (see OrderComparator for further explanation) and an order being filled means 
    a new order is now first in line to be matched.

Attributes
    buyOrders : PriorityQueue of buy orders.
    sellOrders : PriorityQueue of sell orders
    matchesFound : ArrayList of JSON Strings, each JSON is a serialised version of a MatchingDetails
                   object.
Methods
    match(TradeBook) - ArrayList<String> : Takes a TradeBook as input, evaluates the TradeBook for matches, process
                       them and returns an ArrayListof MatchingDetails JSONs that are used to update the DB.
    processMatches() : Helper method called by the match() method: this method is responsible for updating
                       orders in the TradeBook - adjusting quantities, creating and serialising the MatchingDetails
                       objects, appedning to the matchesFound list and removing completed orders from the TradeBook,
                       so we dont erroneously pricess them again.
    matchPossible(buyOrders, sellOrders) : Helper method used by the match() method : This method looks at both sides
                                           of the TradeBook and checks is there is exactly one match possible, returns
                                           true while one match is possible and false when there arent any matches pos-
                                           sible.
