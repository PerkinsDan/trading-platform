What does it do ?
    A TradeBook holds all if the active BUY and SELL orders for a
    particular stock. BUY AND SELL orders are held in separate PriorityQueues
    The PriorityQueues sort orders according to price-time priority automatically,
    meaning we dont ever have to worry abut sorting the orders ourselves. We can just
    poll Orders from the front of hte queue and match them.

When do we use it?
    TradeBook is used by in the TradeBookMap attribute of the OrderProcessor class.
    Its mainly useful for keeping our Orders sorted correctly. We create the TradeBookMap
    and by extension the TradeBook objects on startup of the app and keep them in-memory 
    indefinitely.
